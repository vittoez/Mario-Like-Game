## Game Code Overview

### Core Engine (`engine.js`)
The `GameEngine` class manages the game loop, rendering, and physics. It includes:
- **Entity Management**: Add and update game objects (e.g., player, enemies).
- **Game Loop**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations.
- **Gravity Simulation**: Adds realistic physics to the game.

### Game-Specific Logic (`game.js`)
The `game.js` file defines entities like the player and enemies:
- **Player Class**:
  - Handles movement (arrow keys) and jumping.
  - Implements collision detection with the ground and screen boundaries.
- **Enemy Class**:
  - Moves across the screen at variable speeds.
  - Respawns when it moves out of bounds.

### Visuals (`style.css`)
The CSS file includes:
- **Background Gradient**: Simulates a sky effect for the game environment.
- **Canvas Styling**: Ensures proper rendering for the game.

## Customization
You can easily extend the game by:
- **Adding Levels**: Define new obstacles, enemies, and layouts in `game.js`.
- **Improving Visuals**: Add sprites and animations to `assets/`.
- **Enhancing Gameplay**: Include collectibles, score tracking, or new player abilities.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Background Music and Effects**: Integrate audio for a richer experience.
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Add depth by scrolling background layers.
- **Level Design**: Introduce multiple levels with checkpoints.
- **Mobile Controls**: Add support for touch controls.

## Development Notes
This game uses a modular structure to separate concerns:
1. **Engine Logic**: Contains physics, rendering, and core updates.
2. **Game-Specific Logic**: Focuses on gameplay elements like players and enemies.
3. **Styling**: Decouples visuals into the CSS file for easy customization.

### Browser Compatibility
Tested in modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Ensure your browser supports HTML5 Canvas.
